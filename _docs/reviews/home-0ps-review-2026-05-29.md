# home-0ps.com Review — 2026-05-29

> Generated: 2026-05-29 (`/lab-review`). Supersedes `home-0ps-review-2026-05-28.md`.
> **Updated: 2026-05-29 PM** — re-run after a public-docs-site session on branch `docs/bootstrap-guide`. Cluster state **carried forward** from the AM run (1Password auth prompt dismissed at 11:47Z → live cluster not re-verified this run; snapshot in Section 2 is the AM-verified state, marked accordingly).
> Scope: Live `memphis` dev cluster — Flux applied revision `0a47a77` (one tick behind branch tip `b5e71cb`; reconcile pending for the kromgo configMapGenerator refactor). **Plus** the public guide site on unmerged branch `docs/bootstrap-guide` (Cloudflare Pages, separate from cluster GitOps — see DOC items).
> Trigger: **A heavy observability+CI day**, then a docs-site polish session. Three baseline items closed (F-1+F-2+F-3, O-7 remaining alerts), six new fixes shipped (PVCNearFull template, kromgo end-to-end, flux scrape rewrite, CI lint workflow); PM session reworked the MkDocs landing page (clickable grid cards + section landing pages). **13 non-merge commits + 2 PR merges on `dev` since baseline; +3 docs commits on `docs/bootstrap-guide`.**

## Executive Summary

The day's headline: **kromgo live cluster-stat badges shipped in README.md, the verification flushed out two latent observability bugs that had silently been costing us alerting coverage, and a CI gate now blocks the class of bug that started the cascade.**

The kromgo rollout was the trigger:
- **kromgo HelmRelease + initial config + 10 PromQL endpoint badges in `README.md`** (`11f008e`) — Prometheus → shields.io endpoint proxy fronted by cloudflared at `dev-kromgo.home-0ps.com`. Public CNAME + tunnel ingress + Cloudflare rate-limit ruleset extended to cover both hostnames (terraform/cloudflare-tunnel applied successfully).
- **Verification surfaced a 3-of-10 PromQL miss** (`cf2558c`): bjw-s's reference config filters node-exporter on `{kubernetes_node!=""}`; this lab's node-exporter targets don't carry that label, so CPU/Memory/Uptime returned "no data". Selector dropped.
- **Verification also surfaced the bigger find** (`56df0f2`): the flux `ServiceMonitor` had three independent defects and had been silently matching zero pods since the cluster bootstrapped 4 days ago — `flux_*` / `gotk_*` series were entirely absent. Replaced with a `PodMonitor` scraping all four controllers directly on `:8080/http-prom`. The `FluxKustomizationNotReady` / `FluxHelmReleaseNotReady` alerts shipped via O-7 now actually have data to evaluate against.
- **Kromgo's no-reload behavior was the third gotcha** (`b5e71cb`): kromgo reads `/kromgo/config.yaml` once at startup, ignores filesystem updates. The `cf2558c` fix landed in the ConfigMap via Flux, propagated to the pod's mount, and the running process still served the old config. Refactored to a kustomize `configMapGenerator` with the default name-suffix hash — every config edit produces a new ConfigMap name, kustomize rewrites the Deployment's volume reference, rollout is automatic. No Stakater Reloader needed.

The CI gate (`6931fa8` + `3384cae` + `e7c2c9d`): **`promtool check rules`** on every PR + push, catching Sprig template functions (`mul`, `div`, `add`, `default`) that parse-pass YAML lint + CRD schema but fail at the Prometheus Operator's mutating webhook. The PVCNearFull `(mul $value 100)` Sprig-ism shipped via O-7 (PR #50) on 2026-05-28 and only surfaced 2026-05-29 when Flux re-applied during the kromgo reconcile (`11f008e`), blocking the whole observability layer until fix (`8a7a6f7`). The new workflow also runs yamllint — extended ignore list for `_hack/`, `.venv-docs/`, `**/.sops.yaml`, and 6 explicitly-named SOPS-encrypted YAMLs that don't follow the `*.enc.yaml` naming convention; ~10 trivial trailing-blank-line nits fixed in-place. Local `/lint` and CI now behave identically.

Baseline catch-up: **F-1 + F-2 + F-3 closed** via PR #49 (FALCO-BUNDLE — custom-rules mounted, falcosidekick UI + Redis disabled, `modern_ebpf` verified). **O-7 remaining alerts closed** via PR #50 (cert expiry tiers + PVC near-full + Gatus endpoint-down).

Live state is healthy: **6 nodes Ready** (Talos `v1.12.8` / k8s `v1.35.0`, ~4d4h), **17 Flux Kustomizations Ready at `0a47a77`**, **17 HelmReleases Ready**, no pods outside Running/Completed, 3 certs Ready (wildcard on letsencrypt-**production**), **3 CNPG clusters single-instance** (all 1/1), **10 VolumeSnapshots ReadyToUse** (daily snaps firing for all 3 — authentik 04:30 / freshrss 04:00 / gatus 05:00; gatus's missing-snapshot worry from the 2026-05-28 review resolved itself), 3 dump CronJobs scheduled.

Two TargetDown alerts firing: **authentik-server-metrics** and **authentik-worker-metrics** — the O-9 ServiceMonitor is in `monitoring/authentik` but the chart-side metrics services in `authentik/` are unreachable. Captured as **O-17**.

**Freshest open thread (PM):** the public guide site on `docs/bootstrap-guide` — landing-page grid cards fixed + section landing pages added (`030949f`); branch is unmerged to `dev`. Pick up at **DOC-1/DOC-2** (confirm CF Pages build + icons, then merge).

**Recommended next sprint:** **O-15 KSM label allowlist + `flux_version` PromQL rewrite** (15 min — closes the last broken kromgo badge) + **O-17 authentik scrape repair** (resolves the TargetDown firing) + **O-10 postgres-exporter** (now possible since the KSM allowlist work overlaps with the per-CNPG scrape pattern).

## Section 1 — What Changed Since 2026-05-28

| Area | 2026-05-28 state | 2026-05-29 state |
| ---- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| **kromgo (NEW)** | — | ✅ Live: 10 PromQL endpoints, configMapGenerator-driven rollouts, public via cloudflared at `dev-kromgo.home-0ps.com`, rate-limited. 9/10 metrics rendering on README badges. `flux_version` open (O-15). |
| **Flux scrape (O-13)** | ❌ ServiceMonitor matched zero pods (3 independent defects); zero `flux_*`/`gotk_*` series cluster-wide for the entire prior install | ✅ PodMonitor scraping all 4 controllers (`up=1` × 4) — O-7's FluxKustomizationNotReady / FluxHelmReleaseNotReady alerts now have data |
| **PrometheusRule CI gate (O-12)** | ❌ No promtool validation; PVCNearFull Sprig-ism slipped through PR #50 | ✅ `.github/workflows/lint.yml` — yamllint + `promtool check rules` on every PR + push to `dev` |
| **PVCNearFull alert** | ❌ Broken (`mul` undefined) — blocked entire observability layer reconcile | ✅ Fixed (`humanizePercentage`) — `8a7a6f7` |
| **Falco (F-1+F-2+F-3)** | 🟡 DS live but custom-rules unmounted; UI + Redis shipping by default; `modern_ebpf` unverified | ✅ All closed (PR #49) — custom-rules mounted, UI + Redis off (orphan PVC remains), `modern_ebpf` loaded |
| **O-7 remaining alerts** | 🟡 Partial (CNPG done; cert/PVC/Gatus still open) | ✅ Done (PR #50) — cert expiry (2 tiers) + PVC near-full + GatusEndpointDown |
| **YAML linting in CI** | ❌ `/lint` slash-command only (advisory) | ✅ yamllint job in `lint.yml`; ignore list extended; baseline nits fixed in-place |
| **kubectl wrapper docs** | In `README.md` | ✅ Moved to `_docs/kubectl-wrapper.md` |
| **README badges** | Live status table + tech-stack badges | ✅ + `## Cluster` block (10 kromgo endpoint badges); architecture badges filled out (Falco, Loki, Gatus, Trivy, Alloy, Helm, Authentik, SOPS); status-page badge fixed to markdown link |
| **Cloudflare Tunnel ingress** | Gatus only (`dev-status`) | + kromgo (`dev-kromgo`); rate-limit ruleset matches both via `http.host in {...}` |
| **PodMonitors live** | 4 (authentik, freshrss, gatus, tailscale-operator) | 5 (+ flux-system) — tailscale-operator one has historically matched zero targets (worth a check) |
| **VolumeSnapshots ReadyToUse** | 7 | 10 (3 new daily snaps on 2026-05-29) |
| **Dev tip** | `56277b1` | `b5e71cb` (13 non-merge commits + 2 PR merges since baseline) |
| **Public guide site (PM)** | Genericized how-to content live on `docs/bootstrap-guide`; landing page had dead "button" cards + wall of side links; grid cards rendering wonky (bodies escaping the card box) | ✅ Landing page reworked (`030949f`): Material canonical grid-card format (4-space indent + `---` divider) fixes layout; cards are clickable; Reference cards link to NEW section landing pages (`infra/index.md`, `apps/index.md`, `guides/index.md`) wired into nav as section indexes. Branch still **unmerged to `dev`** (DOC-1). |

## Section 2 — Live Cluster Snapshot (2026-05-29 **AM**, applied rev `0a47a77`)

> ⚠️ **Carried forward from the AM run — not re-verified in the PM update.** The PM re-run hit a dismissed 1Password auth prompt (11:47Z) so the live cluster wasn't re-queried. Nothing cluster-side changed in the PM session (docs-site-only work on a separate branch), so this snapshot is still the best-known state. Re-verify with the Section-3 survey commands on next session.

```
Nodes:        6 Ready — 3 cp + 3 worker — Talos v1.12.8 / k8s v1.35.0 — ~4d4h
Flux:         17 Kustomizations Ready at 0a47a77; gitrepo artifact at 0a47a77
              (branch tip is b5e71cb — kromgo configMapGenerator reconcile pending)
HelmReleases: 17, all Ready — falco 8.0.0 (now slim); cnpg 0.27.0; cnpg-crds 1.28.0;
              kps 78.0.0; authentik 2026.2.3; kyverno 3.7.0; cert-manager v1.19.3;
              democratic-csi 0.15.0 (both freenas + local-path); external-dns 1.19.0
              (v0.8.2 webhook).
Certs:        wildcard-tls (letsencrypt-PRODUCTION), trust-manager-tls, op-connect-tls — Ready.
Workloads:    no pods outside Running/Completed.
Falco:        DaemonSet 6/6 Ready (2/2 containers per pod — custom-rules sidecar mounted);
              falcosidekick (1) + k8s-metacollector (1) — all Running, 9h old.
              NO falcosidekick-ui pod, NO redis StatefulSet (F-2 closed).
CNPG:         3 clusters — authentik 1/1, freshrss 1/1, gatus 1/1 (all single-instance,
              static iSCSI PVs). PodMonitors live for all three. Daily snapshots firing.
kromgo:       1 Deployment Ready, 1 ConfigMap, 1 Service, 1 HTTPRoute — public via
              cloudflared at dev-kromgo.home-0ps.com. 9/10 PromQL endpoints returning
              real data; `flux_version` "No Data" (O-15).
ServiceMonitors: 16 (no change from baseline +1 onepassword-connect was already counted).
PodMonitors:  5 — authentik-dev-cluster, freshrss-dev-cluster, gatus-dev-cluster,
              tailscale-operator (historically empty — needs a look), flux-system (NEW).
Snapshots:    VolumeSnapshotClass freenas-iscsi (Retain). 10 ReadyToUse:
              - authentik: snap-20260527, snap-20260528, snap-20260529 (109m), test-backup-1
              - freshrss:  snap-20260527, snap-20260528, snap-20260529 (139m), test-backup-1
              - gatus:     snap-20260529-050000 (79m, FIRST scheduled snap), test-backup-1
ScheduledBackups: authentik (30 4 * * *) + freshrss (0 4 * * *) + gatus (0 5 * * *),
              method volumeSnapshot — all firing.
PVCs:         All Retain.
              - CNPG data on static iSCSI zvols (dev-{authentik,freshrss,gatus}-db-pv, 10Gi).
              - Dumps-pvc per app (20Gi iscsi).
              - prom 50Gi / grafana 5Gi / alertmanager 5Gi all iscsi.
              - ORPHAN: security-falco-falcosidekick-ui-redis-data (1Gi iscsi) — F-2 disabled
                the StatefulSet but Retain policy kept the PVC. Captured as Hyg-2.
StorageClass: iscsi (default, Retain); local-path (default, Retain).
Active alerts: 3 firing — Watchdog (heartbeat, expected), TargetDown × 2 (authentik-server-metrics,
              authentik-worker-metrics). See O-17.
```

Notable:

- **kromgo is the day's headline addition.** Pattern proven end-to-end: Prometheus → shields.io endpoint proxy → cloudflared tunnel → README badges. Reusable pattern for any future cluster-stat exposure. Note the configMapGenerator approach (b5e71cb) — applies broadly any time we need a runtime config to auto-rotate without Reloader.
- **The flux scrape repair (O-13) is the most impactful invisible fix today.** The PodMonitor swap means O-7's two flux alerts now actually evaluate. Going forward, the cluster has working alerting on Flux reconciliation failures for the first time in 4 days.
- **TargetDown × 2 firing on authentik metrics** — O-9's ServiceMonitor (`monitoring/authentik`) is selecting `authentik-server-metrics` + `authentik-worker-metrics` services, but they're not reachable. Either the services aren't exposed (chart needs `metrics.serviceMonitor.enabled: true` to also expose the targets), or the endpoint slice is empty (no backing pods labeled correctly). Captured as O-17.
- **Falco PVC orphan** — `security-falco-falcosidekick-ui-redis-data` (1Gi) remains Bound on iSCSI because the SC is Retain and the StatefulSet was descoped without manual cleanup. PV stays consumed but unused. Captured as Hyg-2.
- **Tailscale-operator PodMonitor** has existed 4d3h with zero targets — its selector likely matches nothing. Captured as O-18.

## Section 3 — Open Items Punch List

Grouped by tier. Each item: **ID · what · status · location · next action.**

### CRITICAL — correctness / data integrity

(No open CRITICAL items.)

### HIGH — security hardening

| ID | Item | Status | Location | Next action |
| -- | ---- | ------ | -------- | ----------- |
| ~~F-1~~ | ~~Falco custom-rules ConfigMap not mounted~~ | ✅ Done 2026-05-28 (`c492d45`, PR #49) | `_lib/controllers/falco/helmrelease.yaml` | `mounts.volumes` + `volumeMounts` wired; DS now 2/2 containers (custom-rules sidecar). |
| ~~F-2~~ | ~~Audit falcosidekick UI + Redis surface~~ | ✅ Done 2026-05-28 (`c492d45`, PR #49) — Hyg-2 orphan PVC follows on | `_lib/controllers/falco/helmrelease.yaml` | `falcosidekick.webui.enabled: false` + `falcosidekick.config.redis.*` disabled. UI gone, Redis StatefulSet gone. PVC orphan remains (Hyg-2). |
| ~~F-3~~ | ~~Verify Falco `modern_ebpf` driver loading~~ | ✅ Done 2026-05-28 (`c492d45`) | — | Confirmed via logs (PR #49 description). |
| H-2 | Cilium NetworkPolicies — `world:443` egress tightening | ⚠️ Open | `_lib/security/cilium-network-policies/` | Tighten to `toFQDNs` once L7 DNS policy is on. Consult [[cilium-gateway-egress-l7-filter]] before narrowing anything Gateway-routed. |
| H-5 | Trivy operator | ❌ Empty dir | `_lib/security/trivy/`, `_lib/security/kustomization.yaml` | Populate HR, wire reports → Prometheus/Grafana. |
| O-5 / G2-2 | Cilium Gateway hardening + public-surface hardening | 🟡 Rate-limit done (both `dev-status` + `dev-kromgo` covered); headers/WAF still open | exposed HTTPRoutes + public hostnames | Strip `Server`/`X-Powered-By`, body-size limits on the Gateway listeners; Cloudflare managed WAF rules. |

### Observability follow-ups

| ID | Item | Status | Location | Next action |
| -- | ---- | ------ | -------- | ----------- |
| O-5 | Gateway + public-surface hardening | 🟡 (rate-limit done; headers/WAF open — see HIGH) | — | — |
| O-6 | Periodic posture scans | ❌ | — | `popeye` + `kubescape` CronJobs → Loki. |
| ~~O-7~~ | ~~Follow-up app alerts~~ | ✅ Done 2026-05-29 (`df2c03a`, PR #50; PVCNearFull patched in `8a7a6f7`) | `_lib/observability/kube-prometheus-stack/prometheusrule-custom.yaml` | All 4 alerts live: CNPGBackupStale, CNPGDumpCronJobStale, CertExpiringSoon (2 tiers), PVCNearFull (2 tiers), GatusEndpointDown. **Now FluxKustomizationNotReady / FluxHelmReleaseNotReady actually evaluate** thanks to O-13. |
| O-8 | Default-deny CCNP (cluster-wide fail-closed) | 🟡 Per-app default-deny landed | — | Add cluster-wide default-deny for unlabeled namespaces (Q4). |
| ~~O-9~~ | ~~App-level dashboards/alerts~~ | ✅ ServiceMonitor + 4 dashboards live | `_lib/observability/kube-prometheus-stack/{servicemonitor-authentik.yaml, dashboards/}` | But: ServiceMonitor's targets are TargetDown — see O-17. |
| O-10 | **App-data dashboards in Grafana** (postgres-exporter) | ❌ Open | `_lib/observability/` (postgres-exporter HR or per-CNPG sidecar) | 3 CNPG clusters now (authentik/freshrss/gatus); pattern should be shared. Mind [[cilium-gateway-egress-l7-filter]] — exporters need explicit CCNP egress to the target CNPG on 5432. Pairs well with O-15 KSM allowlist work (touching the same HelmRelease). |
| ~~O-11~~ | ~~Gatus endpoint statuses in repo README~~ | ✅ Done 2026-05-28 (`6f51280`) | `README.md` | — |
| ~~O-12~~ | ~~PR CI lacks PromQL alert-template validation~~ | ✅ Done 2026-05-29 (`6931fa8`+`3384cae`+`e7c2c9d`) | `.github/workflows/lint.yml` | promtool job + yamllint job, both green on `e7c2c9d`. |
| ~~O-13~~ | ~~Flux controllers had never been scraped~~ | ✅ Done 2026-05-29 (`56df0f2`) — `up=1` × 4 | `_lib/observability/kube-prometheus-stack/podmonitor-flux.yaml` | — |
| O-14 | Adapt third-party reference configs to local conventions | ❌ Open | `.claude/rules/` (proposed) | Codify a rule: spot-check label vocabularies against this cluster's actual series before merging any community-sourced PromQL / dashboards / scrape configs. Triggered by O-12 (Sprig-isms) and O-15 (`flux_instance_info` doesn't exist here). |
| **O-15** | **`flux_version` kromgo badge "No Data"** — KSM label allowlist needed | ❌ **Open — top of next sprint** | `_lib/observability/kube-prometheus-stack/helmrelease.yaml` (KSM values) + `_lib/observability/kromgo/config/config.yaml` (`flux_version` query) | bjw-s's `flux_instance_info` is a flux-operator addon metric we don't run. Vanilla Flux emits only operational metrics. **Tomorrow:** (1) `kube-state-metrics.metricLabelsAllowlist: ["pods=[app.kubernetes.io/version,app.kubernetes.io/part-of,app.kubernetes.io/component]"]` on the kps HR — exposes `kube_pod_labels` with `label_app_kubernetes_io_version` for every workload. (2) Rewrite kromgo query: `label_replace(max by (label_app_kubernetes_io_version) (kube_pod_labels{namespace="flux-system",label_app_kubernetes_io_part_of="flux"}), "revision", "$1", "label_app_kubernetes_io_version", "v(.+)")` — returns suite version (`2.8.8`) not the source-controller image tag (`1.8.5`). 15min change + verify. |
| ~~O-16~~ | ~~Kromgo ConfigMap edits silently no-op until pod restart~~ | ✅ Done 2026-05-29 (`b5e71cb`) | `_lib/observability/kromgo/kustomization.yaml` (configMapGenerator) | — |
| **O-17** | **TargetDown firing × 2 on authentik metrics scrape** | ❌ **NEW** | `_lib/observability/kube-prometheus-stack/servicemonitor-authentik.yaml` + `_lib/applications/authentik/overlays/dev/` | ServiceMonitor selects `authentik-server-metrics` + `authentik-worker-metrics` services but Prometheus reports them down. Likely either (a) chart `metrics.serviceMonitor.enabled: false` is suppressing the metrics services themselves, (b) services exist but have no endpoints (backing pod label mismatch), or (c) network policy blocking. **Next action:** `kube dev -n authentik get svc | grep metrics` then `kube dev -n authentik describe ep <svc>` to see what's actually exposed. 30min triage. |
| **O-18** | **tailscale-operator PodMonitor has 0 targets (4d3h old)** | ❓ **NEW — needs triage** | `tailscale` namespace, ts-operator chart | PodMonitor exists since cluster bootstrap, never matched a pod (no `up{}` series). Either selector mismatch or operator pods don't expose metrics. Quick check: `kube dev -n tailscale get podmonitor -o yaml` + `kube dev -n tailscale get pod --show-labels`. |

## Section 4 — Thoth & future apps — Status

**Thoth** — ✅ Descoped (ADR-0005). No change.

**docs-site (in-cluster wiki)** — 🗑️ Retired 2026-05-26. No change. Not to be confused with the public guide site below.

**Public guide site** — 🟡 In flight on `docs/bootstrap-guide` (Cloudflare Pages). PM session fixed the landing-page grid cards + added section landing pages. Branch unmerged to `dev` (DOC-1); icon render pending user check (DOC-2).

**Gatus** — ✅ Live + hardened + persistent. Daily snapshots firing as of 2026-05-29 (the missing-snap concern from 2026-05-28 review resolved).

**Cloudflare Tunnel** — ✅ Live (G0) + rate-limited; now fronts both Gatus and kromgo.

**GPU sharing** — pre-decision (ADR-0004) unchanged.

**Falco** — ✅ Live + slimmed (H-3 + F-1+F-2+F-3 all closed). DS 6/6 with custom-rules sidecar; UI + Redis off. Orphan PVC tracked as Hyg-2.

**kromgo** — ✅ Live (NEW). 10 PromQL endpoint badges in README; 9/10 rendering. `flux_version` open as O-15.

## Section 5 — Suggested Next Sprint

In order, cut at natural stopping points:

0. **DOC-1 + DOC-2 — land the public guide site** (in flight, quick). Confirm the CF Pages build is green + icons render (DOC-2), then review the 26-file `docs/bootstrap-guide` diff and merge to `dev` (DOC-1). This is the freshest open thread — pick up here.
1. **O-15 + O-17 + O-18 — observability cleanup bundle** (90 min). KSM label allowlist + kromgo `flux_version` query rewrite; authentik TargetDown triage; tailscale-operator PodMonitor sanity check. Closes the visible "broken badge" + the firing alerts in one PR. Natural cut.
2. **O-10 postgres-exporter** (multi-day). Three CNPG clusters now warrant a shared exporter pattern. Mind [[cilium-gateway-egress-l7-filter]] for CCNPs. Pairs with O-15 because both touch the kps HelmRelease.
3. **O-14 — codify the "audit community configs" rule** (15 min). One file in `.claude/rules/`. Pre-emptive against the next bjw-s/onedr0p copy-paste class of bug.
4. **Hyg-2 + Hyg-3 — quick housekeeping** (15 min). Delete orphan Redis PVC; fix the 3 cluster-config comment warnings.
5. **SO-2 + SO-3 sprint-orchestrator polish** — document recovery patterns + state-file schema versioning.
6. **H-5 Trivy** — populate the empty `_lib/security/trivy/` HR.
7. **I-1 Talos unpin + R5 memory typo + R1/R2 verify** — small Terraform housekeeping batch.
8. **O-5/O-6 + WAF managed rules** — gateway header stripping + posture scans + Cloudflare WAF on public hostnames.
